ack-grep (2.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The program "ack" is no more renamed to "ack-grep" since the conflicting
  "ack", a Kanji code converter, has been removed from Debian (see #662114).

  For a transitional phase of one Debian release, the package will though
  contain symlinks from ack-grep to ack for backwards compatibility.
