ack-grep (1.76-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream
    - Don't depend on filesystem order for tests (Closes: #451403)
  * Add dependency on perl-doc (Closes: #462320)
    - I believe this to be the least intrusive of the suggested
      fixes. If anybody is interested in having ack-grep installed
      without perl-doc installed please reopen this bug or report a
      whishlist bug.
  * Bump standards-version (no changes)
  * Exclude some test files from being cleaned by dh_clean
